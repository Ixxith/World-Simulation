# World-Simulation
This is a Personal project by me. The goal is to build a simulator that replicates real world behavior in a fantasy based envirnonment. The project is built in TypeScript, and is adapted to run on Glitch. 

Classes.ts is based on [this design](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/ce5fb52d-d73a-473a-affc-d840103c9d11/edit?invitationId=inv_e9ace419-023b-4e50-86a9-ae16c72adcf8) made by me.
